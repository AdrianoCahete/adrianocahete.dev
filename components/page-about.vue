      I'm <strong>Adriano Cahete</strong>, a
      <strong>Design Technologist & DesignOps</strong> from Brazil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work across multiple product design areas, such as interaction, motion,
      UX, and UI,
      <strong>
        with more than {{ new Date().getFullYear() - 2010 }} years of experience

      My core competencies include designing and developing digital products,
      using React/Nuxt/Vue, that meet the needs and expectations of users and
      clients. I also specialize in bridging the gap between designers and
      developers, creating a better design/developer experience (DX) and
      implementing DesignOps and GitOps practices.
